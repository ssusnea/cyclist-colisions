# mini-project-3

Hello! If you're reading this, you probably came from my website and already know what this repository is for. 

The code for this project can be found in the file titled mp3_code.qmd. I wanted a place where I can show the code that I wrote for these projects to give an insight into my process and how I made my visualizations. 

You can download the data I used from the following links: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95 and https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/New-York-City-Bike-Routes/7vsa-caz7

Thanks for looking!
